 Sound of nature
‣ The sound of wading through shallow water, picking your feet out and putting them
  back in. Maybe on a beach or in wetland.




‣ Gull wheeling overhead on beach with wave sound in background




                                             9
Sound of human




                 10
Sound
‣ Physical definition
  - A vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave,
    through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or
    solid.


‣ Psychophysical definition
  - Reception of such acoustic waves and their perception
    by the brain.




                                          11
Waves                                       Longitudinal = Primary 纵波
                                            Transverse = Secondary 横波
‣ Sound is transmitted through gases, plasma, and liquids as longitudinal waves, also
  called compression waves.

Quantifying sound
‣ Physical characteristics              ‣ Perceptual characteristics
  - Intensity                             - Loudness (Psychological Strength)
  - Frequency                             - Pitch (Psychological high/low sound)
  - Time variation and frequency          - Timbre (Psychological tone color)

Frequency and pitch




                      19
Pitch
‣ Pitch: Perceptual property
  - Low pitch <=> low frequency of vibration/oscillation
  - High pitch <=> high frequency of vibration/oscillation




                                            20
Frequency
‣ Frequency: Physical property
  - An expression of how frequently a periodic wave form or signal repeats itself
    at a given amplitude
                           50Hz

 A0 is equal to 27.5 Hz while A4 is equal to 440 Hz. Notes start from A0 and go to C8 from left to right.

Time domain vs frequency domain




                   25
Frequency and pitch
‣ Pitch depends primarily (approximately) logarithmically on frequency




                                           26
Human hearing range
‣ Human can hear frequencies above about 20 Hz




                                       27
Frequency and pitch




                      28
Intensity and loudness
‣ Intensity is an objective comparison of
  sound power per unit area. But the ear
  responds in a non-linear way to that
  sound intensity.


‣ Loudness is the strength of the ear’s
  perception of the sound. It is a subjective
  measurement of perception.




                                                29
Loudness vs intensity




                    30
Loudness and spectra                       Fundamental frequency


‣ Upper spectrum: Spectrum of the
  first 0.3 seconds
‣ Lower spectrum: Spectrum of the
  last 0.3 seconds



‣ Observations
  - Fundamental frequency is hardly
    changed
  - Higher harmonics make the note
    sound louder


                                      31
Decibel (dB)
‣ Decibel: a logarithmic unit used to measure sound level - difference as a ratio

‣ Example: One loudspeaker plays a sound with power P1, and another plays a louder
  version of the same sound with power P2, but everything else (how far away,
  frequency) kept the same
                                10log(𝑃! /𝑃" )dB
  - P2 is twice as much power than P1
                                10log(𝑃! /𝑃" ) = 10log(2) ≈ 3dB
  - P2 has a million times the power of P1
                                10log(𝑃! /𝑃" ) = 10log1,000,000 ≈ 60dB
                                             32
Loudness = volume?
‣ Loudness is the noise level perceived by an individual, whereas volume is an absolute
  sound level that can be scientifically measured. For example, if your family is
  watching a movie together, the TV volume is the same for everyone in the room.
  However, the TV's loudness may be much less for a person with a hearing
  impairment than it is for a person with normal hearing.


‣ If you increase the volume on a television, it will also incrementally increase the
  loudness of the sound. However, increasing the volume will not increase the loudness
  to the same degree for every person.




                                             33
Timbre (also known as tone color/quality)
‣ Depends strongly on envelope (time variation) and also depends on spectrum




                                        34
Timbre: Spectrum and harmonics
‣ A periodic wave has a harmonic spectrum
  - Spectrum includes both magnitude of the harmonics and their relative phases
  - Our ears are not very sensitive to relative phase

‣ Harmonic series: a set of frequencies f, 2f, 3f, 4f, f is the fundamental frequency




                                                             35
