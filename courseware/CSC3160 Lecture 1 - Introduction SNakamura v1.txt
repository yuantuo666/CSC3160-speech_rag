Research Proposal Report
- Overall quality of report (total 7)
  - Reference to Prior Work (2)
  - Originality and creativity (2)
  - Technical Correctness (2)
  - Clarity of writing (1)

- Peer review (total 3)
    • Constructive review of other reports. Each reviews the reports of others.
    The reviews are NOT used to rate other reports.



                                                                                  10
Workload
 ‣ If you don’t want to get an A or earn fundamental knowledge of speech and language
   processing only, the workload is NOT very heavy.


 ‣ If you want to have a career in the speech and language processing area, please
   spend more time on your own.


 ‣ If you want to have actual research skills, please visit professors and join projects.
   We welcome you to work together!!

Honesty code
‣ Strict zero-tolerance policy for cheating or plagiarism
  - Discussions are encouraged, but not sharing code or copying code
‣ We will use software to detect plagiarism automatically

‣ Scenarios
  - A shares code with B, and B directly used the code for their assignment. Both zero
  - A and B directly copies from internet independently. Both zero

What is ISCA?
‣ International Speech Communication Association
‣ Overview
‣ ISCA is a Nonprofit Association. The purpose of the Association is to promote speech communication science and technology in
   an international, worldwide context.

‣ The Association will achieve its purpose by:
   • stimulating scientific research and education;
   • organizing conferences and exhibitions;
   • organizing courses;
   • publishing and promoting the distribution of scientific papers;
   • promoting the study of different languages;
   • promoting scientific exchanges;
   • collaborating with other existing organizations;
   • promoting relations between research and industry;
   • serving regional and global needs;
                                                                                                                                 48

What is ACL?
‣ What is the ACL and what is Computational Linguistics?
‣ The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the premier international
  scientific and professional society for people working on computational problems
  involving human language, a field often referred to as either computational linguistics
  or natural language processing (NLP).
‣ The association was founded in 1962, originally named the Association for Machine
  Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL), and became the ACL in 1968.
  Activities of the ACL include the holding of an annual meeting each summer and the
  sponsoring of the journal Computational Linguistics, published by MIT Press; this
  conference and journal are the leading publications of the field. For more information,
  see: https://www.aclweb.org/.



                                                                                            50
‣ What is Computational Linguistics?
‣ Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective.
  Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic
  phenomena. These models may be "knowledge-based" ("hand-crafted") or "data-driven" ("statistical" or
  "empirical").
‣ Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is
  trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and
  in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working
  component of a speech or natural language system.
‣ Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including
  speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search
  engines, text editors, and language instruction materials, to name just a few.
‣ Popular computational linguistics textbooks include:
  • Christopher Manning and Hinrich Schütze (1999) Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing,
     Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. MIT Press.
     Also see the book's supplemental materials website at Stanford.

  • Daniel Jurafsky and James Martin (2008) An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational
     Linguistics, and Speech Recognition, Second Edition. Prentice Hall.
