                                        How Large are “Large” LMs?

             ❖      Today, we mostly talk about two models:
                       ➢Medium-sized models: BERT/RoBERTa models (100M or 300M), T5 models
                        (220M, 770M, 3B)
                       ➢“Very” large LMs: models of 100+ billion parameters

             ❖      Larger model sizes needs larger computation, more expensive during inference
             ❖      Different sizes of LMs have different ways to adapt and use them
                       ➢ Fine-tuning, zero-shot/few-shot prompting, in-context learning…
             ❖      Emergent properties arise from model scale
             ❖      Trade-off between model size and corpus size

         • Language models as knowledge base?

    • Larger capacity to learn problem-solving Abilities
         • Coding, revising articles, reasoning etc.

    • Better generalization to unseen tasks




    • Emergent ability

      Emergent properties in LLMs:
         Some ability of LM is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models
      Emergent Capability: Few-shot prompting




          > A few-shot prompted task is emergent if it
          achieves random accuracy for small models
          and above-random accuracy for large
          models.

                  Feedback
• fine-tune large language models (LLMs) so that their responses
  better align with human preferences, beyond just learning
  language patterns.
• It's used in systems like ChatGPT, InstructGPT, and Claude to
  make models more helpful, honest, and harmless.




                                                                   50
                          3-Stage Training Process: RLHF
   • 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
         • Use instruction–response pairs created by humans. The model learns to
           follow instructions by supervised learning.
         • Example:json
         { "instruction": "Translate this sentence into French.", "input": "How are
         you?", "output": "Comment ça va ?"}


         • This stage is often referred to as instruction tuning.

                          3-Stage Training Process: RLHF
   • 2. Reward Model (RM) Training
         • Collect multiple model outputs for the same prompt.
         • Have humans rank them from best to worst.
         • Train a reward model to predict which response a human would prefer.
         • Example:
               • Prompt: Explain black holes to a 10-year-old.
               • Output A: A black hole is...Output B: It's a region of spacetime...


               • Human preference: A > B
         • → Reward model learns to give A a higher score

                          3-Stage Training Process: RLHF
   • 3. Reinforcement Learning (PPO)
         • Use PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) to fine-tune the model.
         • The model is updated to generate outputs that maximize the reward
           score given by the reward model.
         • PPO helps stabilize training and prevent large, harmful policy updates.

Three important abilities that the initial GPT-3 exhibit:
         ❏       Language generation: follow a prompt and then generate a completion of the given prompt.
         ❏       In-context learning: Follow a few examples of a given task and then generate the solution for a new
                 test case.
         ❏       World knowledge: including factual knowledge and commonsense.

 Where do these abilities come from?
          Large-scale pretraining [175B parameters model on 300B tokens]

             ●     Language generation ability comes from the language modeling training objective.
             ●     World knowledge comes from the 300B token training corpora (or where else it could be).
             ●     In-context learning ability, as well as its generalization behavior, is still elusive. There is some studies on why
                   language model pretraining induces in-context learning, and why in-context learning behaves so differently than
                   fine-tuning. Here are some materials, we may spend a lecture focusing on this.

      Are these abilities already there after pretraining or later injected by fine-tuning?
        ❏     There is still no hard evidence showing training on code is absolutely the reason for
              CoT and complex reasoning.

                                                What’s ChatGPT
    • Phase 1: pre-training
         • Learn general world knowledge, ability, etc.

    • Phase 2: Supervised finetuning
         • Tailor to tasks (unlock some abilities)

    • Phase 3: RLHF
         • Tailor to humans
         • Even you could teach ChatGPT to do something


        Most of these were explored by InstructGPT. The only difference is that it is further trained with chat data, as an
        success of product (plus engineering).

   ❏       Make progress towards multilingualism: GPT-4 is able to answer thousands of multiple-choice questions in 26
           languages with a high degree of accuracy.
   ❏       Longer memory for conversations: ChatGPT can process 4,096 tokens. Once this limit was reached, the model lost
           track. GPT-4 can process 32,768 tokens. Enough for an entire short story on 32 A4 pages.
   ❏       Multimodal input: not only text can be used as input, but also images in which GPT-4 can describe objects. (It is
           not released yet)

GPT-4 Technical Report from OpenAI
       ❏     Only contains a small amount of detail: “[...] given both the competitive landscape and the
             safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about
             the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction,
             training method or similar.” From Technical Report.
       ❏     GPT-4’s score on the bar exam was similar to that of the top ten percent of graduates, while
             ChatGPT ranked in among the ten percent that scored the worst.
       ❏     OpenAI hired more than 50 experts who interacted with and tested the model over an extended
             period of time.

   It was finished in August 2022. It takes 7 months for security alignment

                           Difficulties to Replicate ChatGPT
    • Computing resources: money is all you need
    • Data and annotation:
          • Very careful data cleaning、 filtering、selection strategies (training is expensive)
          • Plain corpora(https://github.com/esbatmop/MNBVC)
          • Transferable SFT data (instruction tuning)
          • human feedback data (model-dependent, non Transferable)
    • Algorithms
          • Has some open-source implementation in general
          • Engineering work is not easy (including training tricks and efficient deployment)
          • Releasing a model is easy, keeping polishing it is not!
    • Talents (first-tier young researchers, average age of Open AI guys is 32）
