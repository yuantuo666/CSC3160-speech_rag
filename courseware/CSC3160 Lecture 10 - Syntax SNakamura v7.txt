                at the start of a word, and the other at the end.

              Functional differences in morphology
   • Inflectional morphology
         • Adds information to a word consistent with its context within a sentence
           ( ←Syntax requirement)
              • Student -> students
              • Sleep -> sleeping
              • Listen -> listening

   • Derivational morphology (← New word. Different Part of Speech)
         • Creates new words with new meanings (and often with new parts of speech)
              • Sing -> singer
              • Beauty -> beautiful

                              Syntax is not Morphology
  • Morphology deals with the internal structure of words
  • Syntax deals with combinations of words


  • Morphology is usually irregular
  • Syntax has its irregularities, but it is usually regular
       • Syntax is mostly made up of general rules that apply across-
         the-board

     • Constituent: a group of neighboring words that relate more
       closely to one another than to other words in the sentence
     • Constituents larger than a word are called phrases
          • Noun phrases
          • Prepositional phrases
          • Verb phrases
     • Phrases can contain other phrases
     • One way of viewing the structure of a sentence is as a
       collection of nested constituents

                        Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)
   • Any CFG can be converted into weakly equivalent CNF
   • In CNF, each non-terminal generates two non-terminals

• Fills the upper-triangular
  matrix a column at a
  time
     • From left to right
     • From bottom to top
• This scheme
  guarantees that at

  have all the information
  we need

• Structural ambiguity occurs when the grammar can assign more
  than one parse to a sentence

• Concept of syntax and constituency
     • Syntax deals with combinations of words
• Context-free grammar
     • production rules are independent of the context
• Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm
     • Bottom-up parsing - start with words
     • Dynamic programming
     • Presumes a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form
