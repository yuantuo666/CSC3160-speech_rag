                                            Vocal tract
   • Vocal tract consists of oral tract and nasal tract
         • After the air leave the trachea, it can exit the body through the mouth
           or the nose


         • Nasal sounds: sounds made by air passing through the nose, they use
           both the oral and nasal tracts as resonating cavities
               • e.g. English [m], [n]



   • Phones can be divided into two classes: vowels and
     consonants

   • Consonants
         • Made by restriction or blocking of the airflow in some way, and can be
           voiced or unvoiced


   • Vowels
         • have less obstruction, are usually voiced, and are generally louder
           and longer-lasting than consonants

   • A speech sound that is articulated with a complete or partial
     closure of the vocal tract


   • Place of articulations
         • where in the vocal tract the obstruction of the consonant occurs, and
           which speech organs are involved

   • Consonants are also distinguished by how the restriction in
     airflow is made, for example, by a complete stoppage of air or
     by a partial blockage


   • Stop
         • airflow is completely blocked for a short time
               • Voiced: [b] [d] [g]
               • Unvoiced: [p] [t] [k]

   • Fricatives
         • airflow is constricted but not cut off completely. e.g. [f] [v]

                                       Phone and Phoneme
  Definitions
  • Phoneme: an abstract, contrastive sound category in a language
          —the unit native speakers treat as “the same sound.”
       • Notation: /…/ (slashes), e.g., /t/, /i/.
       • Determined by minimal pairs (e.g., pin vs bin → /p/ vs /b/ are different phonemes in English).

  • Phone: an actually produced speech sound, regardless of whether itʼs contrastive.
       • Notation: […] (square brackets), e.g., [tʰ], [t̪], [ɾ].

  Relationship (allophones)
  • A phoneme can have multiple phones as its allophones
    —context-dependent variants that donʼt change meaning in that language.
  • English /t/ → [tʰ] (aspirated in top), [t] (unaspirated after /s/ in stop),
    [ɾ] (flap in water AmE), [t̚] (unreleased in cat).
    These are phones (surface realizations) of the phoneme /t/.

  How they differ
  • Contrast vs. realization: phonemes contrast in meaning; phones realize phonemes.
  • Language-specific: the same phone can belong to different phonemes in different languages.

                 Grapheme to phoneme Conversion
   • Grapheme: a letter or a group of letters that represent a single phoneme
   • Phoneme: the smallest unit of sound that can distinguish one word from
     another in a particular language


   • When a child says the sound /t/, this is a phoneme. But when they write
     the letter 't', this is a grapheme.

   • Definition
         • A syllable is a phonological unit built around a single nucleus—typically a
           vowel—and optionally flanked by onset (preceding consonants) and coda
           (following consonants). It corresponds to one peak of sonority and is a basic
           unit for stress, rhythm, and prosody.
