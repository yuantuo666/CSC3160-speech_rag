                                          Speech production
  • Contracting the lungs, pushing out air
    from the lungs
        • Airflow in itself is not audible as a sound


  • Obstruct airflow to obtain an oscillation
    or turbulence
        • Oscillations are primarily produced when
          the vocal folds are tensioned
          appropriately
        • Sounds without oscillations in the vocal
          folds are known as unvoiced sounds

          between the vocal folds)

  • The characteristic quality of a sound, independent of pitch and
    loudness


  • Spectral envelope and its time variation can represent timbre


  • The independence of source and filter explains
        • why vowels of the same timbre can be produced on different pitches
        • why vowels of the same pitch can have different timbres

  • The Speech Chain comprises the processes of:
        • speech production
        • auditory feedback to the speaker
        • speech transmission (through air or over an electronic
          wire)
        • communication system (to the listener)
        • speech perception and understanding by the listener.

        • An input of acoustic energy into
          the speech production system
  • Vocal tract filter

    and to the listener

    The Black Box Model of the Auditory System
   • A “black box” behavioral model of hearing and perception
         • Characteristics of the physical sound are varied in a systematic
           manner and the psychophysical observations of the human listener
           are recorded and correlated with the physical attributes of the
           incoming sound
         • We then determine how various attributes of sound (or speech) are
           processed by the auditory system

                        Why do human have two ears?
  • The brain needs input from both ears in order to separate
    sounds efficiently
  • Sound localization
        • Spatially locate sound sources in 3-dimensional sound fields,
          based on two-ear processing, loudness differences at the two
          ears, delay to each ear
  • Sound cancellation
        • Focus attention on a ‘selected’ sound source in an array of
          sound sources – ‘cocktail party effect’, Binaural Masking Level
          Differences (BMLDs)

                    Some facts about human hearing
  • Masking is the phenomenon whereby one loud sound
    makes another softer sound inaudible
        • Frequency masking and Temporal masking
        • Masking is most effective for frequencies around the masker
          frequency
        • Masking is used to hide quantizer noise by methods of spectral
          shaping
          (similar to Dolby noise reduction methods)

                                               For simplicity, we begin by
                                               considering a simple,
                                               cylindrical tube with
                                               length L, open at the lips
                                               and with no glottal
                                               constriction. The maxima
                                               in the impedance Z occur
                                               for wavelengths
                                               approximately λ1=4L,
                                               λ3=4L∕3, λ5=4L∕5, etc., and
                                               thus at frequencies f1=c∕4L,
                                               f3=3c∕4L=3f1, f5=5c∕4L=5f1,
                                               etc. Minima in Z occur at
                                               frequencies roughly half
                                               way between the maxima
