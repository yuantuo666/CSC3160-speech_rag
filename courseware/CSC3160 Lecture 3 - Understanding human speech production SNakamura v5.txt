• Decibel: a logarithmic unit used to measure sound level - difference as a ratio


• Example: One loudspeaker plays a sound with power P1, and another plays a louder
  version of the same sound with power P2, but everything else (how far away, frequency)
  kept the same

                                    10log(𝑃! /𝑃" )dB
   • P2 is twice as much power than P1

                                    10log(𝑃! /𝑃" ) = 10log(2) ≈ 3dB
   • P2 has a million times the power of P1


                                    10log(𝑃! /𝑃" ) = 10log1,000,000 ≈ 60dB

                                          Speech production
  • When a person has the urge or
    intention to speak, their brain forms a
    sentence with the intended meaning


  • Maps the sequence of words into
    physiological movements required to
    produce the corresponding sequence of
    speech sounds

• Contracting the lungs, pushing out air from the lungs
     • Airflow in itself is not audible as a sound


• Obstruct airflow to obtain an oscillation or turbulence
     • Oscillations are primarily produced when the vocal
       folds are tensioned appropriately
     • Sounds without oscillations in the vocal folds are
       known as unvoiced sounds

     • length and mass of the vocal folds


• Pressure and tension can be intentionally changed to
  cause a change in frequency
• The length and mass of the vocal folds are in turn
  correlated with overall body size of the speaker
     • children and females have on average a higher pitch
       than male speakers

  • The shape is determined by a multitude of components, in particular by
    the position of the jaw, lips and tongue


  • The resonances are easily modified by the speaker and perceived by
    the listener

  • Voicing source: Vocal folds vibrating
        • A periodic source produced by the modulation of the airflow
          from the lungs by the vocal folds
              • The vocal folds are muscular folds located in the larynx
        • If the vocal folds are close together, then air pressure from the
          lungs can cause them to vibrate periodically, generating
          voicing.
  • Unvoicing source: vocals fold holds close but not vibrating

• The sound wave at some distance from the speaker is the result of filtering the source with
  the vocal tract filter, plus the radiation characteristics of the lips/nose.

  • A resonant frequency is a natural frequency of vibration determined by
    the physical parameters of the vibrating object.

                                              Resonance
• The resonances of the vocal tract are called formants
• The resonances are easily modified by the speaker and perceived by
  the listener

  • the acoustic features which differentiate vowels from each other are the
    frequencies of the resonances in the vocal tract, corresponding to
    specific places of articulation primarily in terms of tongue position
  • The spectrum of a voiced speech have the structure of a harmonic signal

                                          Frequency vs pitch
  • Frequency of the vocal folds refers to the actual physical phenomenon
  • Resonances in the vocal tract can emphasize harmonics of the fundamental frequency
    such that the harmonics are louder than the fundamental frequency
  • The perceived pitch is then the frequency of the harmonic instead of the fundamental
    frequency.

                  Independence of source and filter
  • Source
        • Fundamental frequency (F0) is driven by the frequency of vocal fold
          vibrations
        • Harmonics are multiples of F0
  • Filter
        • Resonances are driven by the shape of the vocal tract (physical property)
        • Formants are peaks in the spectral envelope that correspond to resonances
          (acoustic property)
  • Independence of source and filter
        • You can change F0 without changing the vowel you are saying: harmonics
          change, formants stay the same

  • The characteristic quality of a sound, independent of pitch and loudness


  • Spectral envelope and its time variation can represent timbre


  • The independence of source and filter explains
        • why vowels of the same timbre can be produced on different pitches
        • why vowels of the same pitch can have different timbres

• Fundamental frequency (F0)

      • F0 is driven by the frequency of vocal fold vibrations, not vocal tract resonances
• In a speech segment, F0 is semi-continuous
