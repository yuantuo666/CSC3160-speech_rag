                                   Constituency
     • Constituent: a group of neighboring words that relate more
       closely to one another than to other words in the sentence
     • Constituents larger than a word are called phrases
          • Noun phrases
          • Prepositional phrases
          • Verb phrases
     • Phrases can contain other phrases
     • One way of viewing the structure of a sentence is as a
       collection of nested constituents

           Distributional Hypothesis (Lenci, 2008)


  • At least certain aspects of the meaning of lexical expressions
   depend on their distributional properties in the linguistic contexts


  • The degree of semantic similarity between two linguistic
   expressions is a function of the similarity of the two linguistic
   contexts in which they can appear

            (fewer weights to tune)
          • Dense vectors may generalize better than explicit counts

               • car and automobile are synonyms; but are distinct dimensions
               • a word with car as a neighbor and a word with automobile as a neighbor

                         CFG vs CSG: What Differs

      • Rule shape: CFG forbids context on the left; CSG allows it
      • Power: CFG handles two-way dependencies; CSG handles
        three-way and copying patterns
      • Parsing: CFG parsing is polynomial (e.g., CYK O(n^3)); CSG
        recognition is far more expensive

                                   Quick Checklist

      • Two synchronized blocks → likely CFG
      • Three or more synchronized blocks → likely needs CSG
      • Copying/duplication → beyond CFG

                                   Summary

      • CFG: single-nonterminal LHS; efficient parsing
      • CSG: contextual constraints; strictly more expressive
      • a^n b^n is CFG; a^n b^n c^n is CSG (not CFG)
