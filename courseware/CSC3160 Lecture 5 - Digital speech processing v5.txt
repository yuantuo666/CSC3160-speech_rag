 The Black Box Model of the Auditory System
• A “black box” behavioral model of hearing and perception
      • Assumption: an acoustic signal enters the auditory system causing
        behavior that we record as psychophysical observations

                       Why do human have two ears?
  • The brain needs input from both ears in order to separate
    sounds efficiently
  • Sound localization
        • Spatially locate sound sources in 3-dimensional sound fields,
          based on two-ear processing, loudness differences at the two
          ears, delay to each ear
  • Sound cancellation
        • Focus attention on a ‘selected’ sound source in an array
           of sound sources – ‘cocktail party effect’, Binaural Masking
          Level Differences (BMLDs)

                                          Digital sound waves

  • Computers deal with discrete data (zeros and ones)

       • We need to convert (sample) the continuous signal into digital presentation
             • Sampling converts continuous time axis to discrete time axis to sample time-varying
               voltage signal.
             • Quantization replaces each real number of the signal voltage with an approximation
               from a finite set of discrete values.


       • Before: Time Axis: Continuous, Amplitude(voltage) Axis: Continuous
       • After:         Time Axis: Discrete, Amplitude Axis: Discrete

                               Windowing for analysis
• A signal of a sound/speech/music is a sequence of acoustic events/words/lyrics
  etc.
• The signal of a sound/speech/music is time-variant in character.
• To extract information from a signal, we must therefore split the signal into
  sufficiently short segments
• Extract segments which are short enough that the properties of the
  sound/speech/music signal does not have time change within that segment.
• Windowing is a method in signal processing and it refers to splitting the input
  signal into temporal segments

                                                  Windowing
• The straightforward windowing is to apply a rectangular window
• The borders of segments are then visible as discontinuities, which are incongruent with
  the real-world signal

                               Windowing for analysis
• By multiplying the input signal with a window function, the windowing function
  also goes to zero at the border (Hanning window) such that the discontinuity at
  the border becomes invisible.
• Windowing does change the signal

                     Fundamental Assumptions
• Properties of speech signal change relatively slowly with time (5-
  10 sounds per second)
  • Short 5-20 msec intervals
       • due to the small amount of data, varying pitch, varying amplitude
  • Medium 20-100 msec intervals
       • due to changes in sound quality, transitions between sounds, rapid transients in Speech

  • Long 100-500 msec intervals
       • Due to large amount of sound changes

• There is always uncertainty in short-time measurements and
 estimates from speech signals
