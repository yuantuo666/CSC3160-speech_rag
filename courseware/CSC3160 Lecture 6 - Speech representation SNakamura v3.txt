      • Computers deal with discrete data (zeros and ones)

            • We need to convert (sample) the continuous signal into digital
              presentation
                 • Sampling converts continuous time axis to discrete time axis to sample time-
                   varying voltage signal.
                 • Quantization replaces each real number of the signal voltage with an
                   approximation from a finite set of discrete values.


            • Before: Time Axis: Continuous, Amplitude(voltage) Axis: Continuous
            • After:         Time Axis: Discrete, Amplitude Axis: Discrete

                                            Windowing
      • The straightforward windowing is to apply a rectangular window
      • The borders of segments are then visible as discontinuities, which are
        incongruent with the real-world signal

      • Convolution is a mathematical way of combining two signals to form a
        third signal.
      • It is the single most important technique in Digital Signal Processing.
      • Using the strategy of impulse decomposition, systems are described by a
        signal called the impulse response.
