       and semantics
     • Words are not atoms
           • They have an internal structure

                                        Linguistic morphology
     • The study of how morphemes join together to form words
     • Morphemes are the minimal units of linguistic form and
       meaning

              Why do we need to learn morphology?
     • The creation of new words
     • The modification of existing words. We create new words
       out of old ones all the time

           Differences between Words and Morphemes
     • Another difference between words and morphemes is that
       between two words, we can usually insert some other
       words, while between two morphemes we can’t

           Differences between Words and Morphemes
     • Whitespace is not always a good test for the word/morpheme
       distinction in English. Compound nouns are often spelled with
       whitespace between their components, yet they are a single
       word

                                               Chinese example
     • In classic Chinese, usually each character is a word and also a
       morpheme
     • Most words in modern Standard Chinese (i.e. Mandarin) are
       compounds
